This is my first blog ever written anywhere on Internet.  
Today I uploaded my first ever python package `jupyter-timetracker` on pypi.org. It can easily be installed via `pip install `jupyter-timetracker`.  
Then you can easily run the application in jupyter notebook as

{% highlight python %}
import timetracker
timetracker.track()
{% endhighlight %}

Check out the [jupyter-timetracker pypi page][jekyll-docs] for more info on how to get the most out of `jupyter-timetracker`. File all bugs/feature requests at [jupyter-timetrackerâ€™s GitHub repo][jekyll-gh]. If you have questions, you can ask them on prateekongithub@gmail.com.
